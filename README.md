# School Dropout Prediction in Mexico

## Introduction

In this project, we will implement a Machine Learning model capable of predicting the probability of a student dropping out of the current academic cycle. This prediction will be based on various characteristics associated with the student, ranging from demographic conditions to factors that facilitate academic performance, such as homework support, financial dependency, and the student's level of academic stress.

## Information Source

For this project, we will utilize data collected from the National Survey on Access and Permanence in Education (ENAPE), conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the official body for conducting and publishing national surveys and censuses.

The survey was conducted via telephone and collects information on all household residents aged 0 to 29 years.

## Objective (Value Proposition)

The primary objective is to provide a tool that helps mitigate dropout rates, which can be achieved through:

a. Identifying the likelihood of dropout for each student.
b. Identifying the factors or conditions that most significantly contribute, both positively and negatively, to dropout.

This information is valuable for focusing efforts within the education system or even for parents to develop action plans, public policies, or special programs to combat school dropout.
